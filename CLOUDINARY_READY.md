## How to Use

1. **Start your dev server** (if not already running):

   npm start
   ```

2. **Go to AddGem page** in your application

3. **Fill in the form** and upload images:
   - Upload one Hero Image (required)
   - Upload additional images (optional)
   - Fill in all other gem details

4. **Submit the form** - Images will be uploaded to Cloudinary automatically

## Uploaded Images Location

All uploaded images will be stored in your Cloudinary account at:
- **Path**: `STJ/` folder
- **Format**: Auto-optimized by Cloudinary
- **Access**: Public URLs ready for your backend

## Backend Requirements

Your backend should accept:
- `heroImage`: String (Cloudinary URL)
- `additionalImages`: Array of Strings (Cloudinary URLs)

Example backend schema:
```javascript
{
  heroImage: { type: String, required: true },
  additionalImages: [{ type: String }]
}
```

## Testing

Try uploading an image now! You should:
1. See the upload progress
2. See the image preview after upload
3. Get a Cloudinary URL starting with `https://res.cloudinary.com/defgskoxv/`

## Troubleshooting

If uploads fail:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify your upload preset `x01b8cid` is set as "Unsigned"
3. Check Cloudinary dashboard for any upload restrictions
